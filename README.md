# William Hall — Systems-Focused Developer

Former aerospace technician turned embedded systems researcher.  
I design high-integrity platforms rooted in PLC control, automation security, and reproducible education tools.

Current focus: **PLC education + HMI integration using the Arduino Opta**  
Driven by mission clarity, process fidelity, and system resilience.
